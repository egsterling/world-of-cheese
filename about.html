            <div class="text">
                World of Cheese was co-founded by expert cheesemakers LeBron James and Danny Devito all the way back in the year 1902.

                The two of them had a vision for the future: they wanted to change the way that people saw cheese in a fundamental way.&nbsp;
                As soon as they began working together, they slowly began expanding the company and improving their craft.&nbsp;Now, over 100 
                years later, their hard work has culminated into one of the largest cheese manufacturers in the United States, 
                one which is still growing today.&nbsp;Although our founders are long retired and have moved onto other endeavours, 
                they will always have a lasting impact in the cheesemaking industry.
